### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile!

Currently I'm using a lot of `JavaScript`, `React`, `Python`, `Flask`, `Docker`,`AWS` in my projects, as well as NLP tools such as `NLTK` and `Gensim`.

I also have experience with `OOP design patterns`, `UML diagrams`, `microservice architecture`, `containerization`, `CI/CD`, `TDD`, `network/web security`. 

In the past, I've worked with `Java`, `Vert.x`, `C#`, `.NET Core`, `Azure`, `Serverless architecture`, and many more.
