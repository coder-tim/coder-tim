### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile!

Currently I'm using a lot of `JavaScript`, `React`, `Python`, `Flask`, `AWS` in my projects, as well as NLP tools such as `Gensim`, `NLTK` and `Gensim`.

I also have knowledge in `OOP design patterns`, `UML diagrams`, `microservice architecture`, `containerization`. 

In the past, I've worked with `Java`, `Vert.x`, `C#`, `.NET Core`, `Azure`, `Serverless architecture`, and many more.
